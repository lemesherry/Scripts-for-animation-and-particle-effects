# Scripts For Animation & Particle Effects
### Custom scripts for animation and particle effects in unity, like text pop up and fading, multidirectional raycasting etc...



* Draw Rays:
- Draw rays script can be used to ray cast in multidirections at once (if you give a 360 value to its direction variable it will raycast from that center point of object to all directions like a ball/circle)
