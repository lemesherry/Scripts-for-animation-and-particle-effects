# Scripts For Animation & Particle Effects
## Custom scripts for animation and particle effects in unity, like text pop up and fading, multidirectional raycasting etc...



### Draw Rays: 
> `Draw rays` script can be used to ray cast in `multidirections` at once (if you give a `360` value to its direction variable it will raycast from that center point of object to all directions `like a ball/circle`).

### RGB Image:
> `RGB Image` script can be used to `change any Image component's color` in RGB `on runtime`.

### RGB Text:
> `RGB Text` script can be used to `change any Text mesh pro component's color` in RGB `on runtime`.

### Rotate UI:
> `Rotate UI` script can be used to `rotate any UI element` on runtime.
